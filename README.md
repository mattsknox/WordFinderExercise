<h1>Word Finder Exercise</h1>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>The solution was developed in the style of a service feature provided by a Web API component with no front-end.</p>

<h3> Execution </h3>

<p>The behavior of the code can be observed by executing a "dotnet run" command in the WordFinder.Core project.  This performs a word find search on the sample values established in the WordFinderTest.cs file and provides the expected responses outlined in the exercise document written directly to the console.</p>

<p>There are a few tests available for execution in the project, which should all pass successfully.  </p>
